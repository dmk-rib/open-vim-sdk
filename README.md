# VIM Open SDK

This repository houses the implementation for various open-source libraries and technologies that we have developed at [VIM](http://vimaec.com) for facilitating the development of more efficient BIM and general purpose 3D applications for ourselves, our partners, and our customers. We believe that the AEC (Architecture, Engineering, and Construction) industry is being held back by lack of software innovation and that the way to move forward is for the community to share access to data and technology. 

At [VIM](http://vimaec.com/about) we push the boundaries of what people have come to expect from their BIM software in terms of performance and scalability by leveraging our collective backgrounds across various industries (film, games, advertising, architecture, construction, CAD, VR/AR, and software).

## Contents

This repository houses implementations and tests for the following libraries and data formats. 

* [VIM](https://github.com/vimaec/vim) - An efficient data format for BIM and 3D data. 
* [Math3D](https://github.com/vimaec/math3d) - A .NET 3D math library. Math3D acts as a drop-in replacement for System.Numerics with added functionality and strict alignment for cross platform serialization. 
* [LinqArray](https://github.com/vimaec/linqarray) - A .NET library that allows LINQ type queries on immutable arrays, while maintaining safety and peformance. 
* [G3D](https://github.com/vimaec/g3d) - A simple and efficient cross-platform 3D geometry format for meshes and point clouds. 
* [BFAST](https://github.com/vimaec/bfast) - A data format for efficient cross-platform serialization of collections of byte arrays
* [VIM Desktop SDK](https://github.com/vimaec/vim-desktop-sdk) - A .NET SDK for extending the VIM desktop application 

While each project above has its own repository, we chose to put all of the implementation in one repository to facilitate testing and deployment, and to more easily accept changes and suggestions from the community at large.
